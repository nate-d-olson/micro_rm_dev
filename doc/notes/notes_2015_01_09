# Micro RM8375 Analysis
## Objective
1. Work on summary of pathoscope results
2. Run pilon using LT2 reference genome, pilon change MiSeq, and pilon Change PGM reference genomes
3. Whole genome comparison using parsnp

## Pathoscope Results Summary
* pathoscope_analysis_v2.Rmd
* Found missing dataset - MiSeq vial 7 library 2, SRR1555311, will need to run
* Summarized the pathoscope contaminant results with Rmarkdown file.

## Running pilon
1. Change pipeline to add reference genome seq name to output results
	* modified run_bwa_mem_pe.py to include reference genome name in output filenames
	* Test run of two datasets, test worked started running full LT2
	* will wait to re-run the PGM data, either need to create a pipeline for running tmap or run using the torrent server
	* note docker container date is the date built not the current date

2. run different reference genomes
<<<<<<< HEAD
	* Mapping MiSeq reads to LT2, HGAP_MiSeq, and HGAP_PGM using run_bwa_mem_pe.py
3. merging bams 
	* merging bam files in ipython notebook code below, similar command run for all three references

	%%bash
	ls ../sequence_purity/mapping_2015_01_09/HGAP_MiSeq*bam >HGAP_MiSeq.miseq.bams
	samtools merge -b HGAP_MiSeq.miseq.bams HGAP_MiSeq_merged.bam
	samtools index HGAP_MiSeq_merged.bam

4. Running pilon
	* Issue running pilon in Docker container on laptop, memmory issue
	* running from the command line 

		java -Xmx8G -jar ../../../utilities/pilon-1.10.jar \
                --genome ../../../data/RM8375/ref/HGAP_MiSeq.fasta \
                --frags HGAP_MiSeq_merged.bam \
                --changes --vcf --tracks \
                --fix "all" --output HGAP_MiSeq.miseq
    
=======
	* started run of LT2 for all MiSeq data at 12:17 PM, successful completion
	* started HGAP_MiSeq at 1:00 PM

## Other
	* Issue with ipython notebook formats and conda on laptop, may need to reinstall anaconda ...
		* Will hold off until better idea of what needs to be done
<<<<<<< HEAD
	* new version of ipython notebook jupyter
