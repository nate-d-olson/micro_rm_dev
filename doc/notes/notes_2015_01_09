# Micro RM8375 Analysis
## Objective
1. Work on summary of pathoscope results
2. Run pilon using LT2 reference genome, pilon change MiSeq, and pilon Change PGM reference genomes
3. Whole genome comparison using parsnp

## Pathoscope Results Summary
* pathoscope_analysis_v2.Rmd
* Found missing dataset - MiSeq vial 7 library 2, SRR1555311, will need to run
* Summarized the pathoscope contaminant results with Rmarkdown file.

## Running pilon
1. Change pipeline to add reference genome seq name to output results
	* modified run_bwa_mem_pe.py to include reference genome name in output filenames
	* Test run of two datasets, test worked started running full LT2
	* will wait to re-run the PGM data, either need to create a pipeline for running tmap or run using the torrent server
	* note docker container date is the date built not the current date

2. run different reference genomes
	* started run of LT2 for all MiSeq data at 12:17 PM, successful completion
	* started HGAP_MiSeq at 1:00 PM



## Other
	* Issue with ipython notebook formats and conda on laptop, may need to reinstall anaconda ...
		* Will hold off until better idea of what needs to be done
