# Micro RM8375 Analysis
## Objective
1. Work on summary of pathoscope results
2. Run pilon using LT2 reference genome, pilon change MiSeq, and pilon Change PGM reference genomes
3. Whole genome comparison using parsnp

## Running pilon
1. Change pipeline to add reference genome seq name to output results
	* modified run_bwa_mem_pe.py to include reference genome name in output filenames
	* Test run of two datasets, test worked started running full LT2
	* will wait to re-run the PGM data, either need to create a pipeline for running tmap or run using the torrent server
	* note docker container date is the date built not the current date

2. run different reference genomes
	* started run of LT2 for all MiSeq data at 12:17 PM
