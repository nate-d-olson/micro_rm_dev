Plans for variant calling
1. mapping reads  to HGAP reference
	* MiSeq BWA
		* TODO - python script with merge
	* PGM - TMAP from Torrent Suite, may want to install in docker
2. run Pilon
3. Compare PGM and MiSeq Pilon - generate revise ref
4. remap and re-run pilon for additional possible changes, iterate steps 1-4 till equilibrium
5. mpileup for for base purity analysis

Approach
1. python script with functions for
	* bwa-mem
	* adding headers
	* sorting and indexing
	* merging bams
	* running pilon
	* mpileup
2. script for running pilon and mapping procedure

Getting started 
* startup boot2docker
	* within boot2docker terminal 
		`docker run -d -p 443:8888 -v ~/Desktop/micro_rm_dev:/notebooks -e "PASSWORD=micro_rm_pw" varcall_notebook`
* in browser localhost:8888


bwa_mem_pe.py has functions for running bwa for Illumina PE data, run_bwa_mem_pe.py runs datasets based on parameters provided input file
see bwa_mem_pipeline_params.txt for example

run within docker 
starting docker container `docker run -i -t -v ~/Desktop/micro_rm_dev:/notebooks varcall_notebook sh'

inside the container run `python run_bwa_mem_pe.py bwa_mem_pipeline_params.txt` from the analysis/bioinf/sequence_purity directory

Improvements 
1. sending command to docker without entering the commandline
2. add the run id to log files or store in seperate directories

Next Steps
1. Code for running pilon
2. function merging bams
