### Notes from 1/13/2015

Objective:
Develop pipeline for generating vcf files for use in consensus base call confidence assessment.

#### Approach
1. on desktop startup variant call docker
	* had to build `sudo docker build varcall_docker_notebook/`
2. starting docker 
	*docker run -d -p 443:8888 -v /media/nolson/second/current_projects/micro_rm_dev/:/notebooks -e "PASSWORD=micro_rm_pw" varcall_notebook -m 10000

Issues with running ipython notebook on desktop
1. did some trouble shooting on laptop now running from command line on desktop
	- `sudo docker run -i -t -v /media/nolson/second/current_projects/micro_rm_dev:/notebooks varcall_notebook sh`
2. running MiSeq data using run_consensus_base_pipeline.py
3. created symbolic links for pgm data using pgm_bam_sym_link.sh
4. modified run_consensus_base_pipeline.py to exclude fixmate step for pgm bam files
	python run_consensus_base_pipeline.py pgm_consensus_base_params.txt
	issues with AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar not seeing bam, making copies of bam files to see if that will fix the issue

	python run_consensus_base_pipeline.py pgm_consensus_base_params.txt - copy did the trick!
5. started pgm consensus base pipeline at 4:50 PM
6. error with SRR1555311 dataset, generating vcf without SRR1555311, full run started 4:55 PM
7. error with PGM SRR1393713- issue with read groups, need to look into, same issue with SRR1555298
