## Analysis Methods Used to Characterize Reference Materials

### Bioinf Directory
Pipelines for processing the raw sequence data.
* genome_purity - purity analysis using pathoscope2
* genome_structure - de-novo assembly of MiSeq and PGM replicates
* sequence_homogeneity - pair-wise variant analysis for replicate vials
* sequence_purity - base level purity analysis, variant calls for all genome positions for individual datasets and subsets.
